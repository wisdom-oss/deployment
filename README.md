### System Requirements
* 100 GB Storage Space
* Debian-based x64 operating system
* Internet Access

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The WISdoM Platform is shipped **without** an OpenID Connect provider.
> You either need to self-host a OpenID Connect provider (e.g, [authentik], 
> [Authelia]) or use a SaaS solution like [auth0] or [Okta]

[authentik]: https://goauthentik.io/
[Authelia]: https://www.authelia.com/
[auth0]: https://auth0.com
[Okta]: https://www.okta.com

### Setup

the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/wisdom-oss/deployment.git wisdom
```
